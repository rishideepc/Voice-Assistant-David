# Voice-Assistant-David
This is a simple Desktop Assistant using Python. 

It can perform basic tasks like open files, launch browsers, greet users according to time of the day, fetch information from the Web, and even send Whatsapp messages, all with the help of voice commands only!

The assistant is made using the speech recognition module in Python. It accepts voice input from user and then performs the tasks as coded.

Open to suggestions and improvements. Thanks!
